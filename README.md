# Reaactjs Movie App

In this project i have tried to make a movie app using **_ReactJS_** , **_ReactHooks_** , **_Axios_**, **materal Ui**, in this app i have tried to use **pagination** to show no of pages available in a particular segment and for icons we have used *React Icons*

In this App you can see Trending Movie, movie & Tv shows

To show the rating of a movie or Tv Show i have used Badges component from Material Ui.

In this App you can search movie or Tv shows by its name.

here we can see movie and Tv shows details for example- release date,overvew etc.. just by clicking on it.

we can see movie or shows according to its geners
